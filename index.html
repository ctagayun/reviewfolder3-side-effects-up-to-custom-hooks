<!-- notice the "html" element where id="root"
     this is exactly where Reacts inserts itself into HTML
     to bootstrap the entire app
     
   While one small HTML file (here: index.html) 
  and one large JavaScript file (here: compiled and bundled 
  src/main.jsx and src/App.jsx files) are transferred from web 
  server to browser, the JavaScript file(s) are mostly responsible 
  to render all the HTML in the browser. The HTML file is only 
  there to request the JavaScript file and to render the HTML 
  element where React inserts itself. From there, React calls 
  all of its needed function components to render itself as 
  component hierarchy.
